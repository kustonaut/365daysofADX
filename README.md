#365daysofADX - Day 1



Want to learn #Kusto? We think there cannot be a better day than today. It's a new year after all :) 



We want to help you in this journey and therefore we are launching #365daysofADX, whose aim is to get you started with Azure Data Explorer (#ADX) a.k.a. Kusto and slowly help you build upon your knowledge base with bite sized info every day, over a year.



Let's begin by creating our own ADX free cluster. You don't need an Azure Subscription, nor a credit card. All you need is a #Microsoft Account (you can create one for free here: https://account.microsoft.com/account) or Azure Active Directory user identity (so if you are already using azure, there won't be any charge for spinning up a free cluster).



Creating the free cluster is a simple 3 step process:



1. Goto aka.ms/kustofree

2. Read and agree to Terms of service and Privacy Policy

3. Sign in and Create cluster



You can edit cluster display name, database name and region before clicking on create.
